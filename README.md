# Apollo — Research you can trust

Multi-agent deep research web application built for the **INNOVISTA Hackathon (Problem Statement 01)**.
Enter one research topic and Apollo plans the investigation, searches multiple sources, reviews evidence gaps, writes the report, and verifies its citations sentence by sentence.

The current version also supports configurable API keys, research domains, platform mixes, live agent events, source-quality filtering, Both Sides conflict analysis, and a deterministic Judge mode.

## Windows Setup Steps (PowerShell)

The repository includes the dependency manifests [backend/requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt),
[frontend/package.json](frontend/package.json), and [frontend/package-lock.json](frontend/package-lock.json).
The `backend\venv`, `frontend\node_modules`, build output, and `.env` files are local generated files and
are intentionally excluded from Git.

### 1. Backend Setup
Open PowerShell in the repository root (`apollo-multi-research`) and run:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Open `backend\.env` and configure your keys and OpenRouter models:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenRouter key from https://openrouter.ai/keys
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Tavily key from https://app.tavily.com
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and optional provider/source keys: Additional integrations supported by the configuration panel
- `FAST_MODEL`: Fast model for searching, section writing, and Truth Meter
- `SMART_MODEL`: Stronger model for planning, review, Judge scoring, and report assembly

API keys can also be added or updated locally from the React configuration panel. Keys are stored in `backend\.env` and expire after 30 days.

### 2. Frontend Setup
Open a second PowerShell window in the repository root (`apollo-multi-research`) and run:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
```

---

## How to Run

### Start Backend (Port 8000)
```powershell
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Start Frontend (Port 5173)
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. The backend health endpoint is available at **http://localhost:8000/api/health**.

### Optional CLI Test Runner
```powershell
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python test_run.py "Why do Indian farmers still burn crop stubble, and which solutions are actually working?"
python test_run.py "Stubble burning policy in a single small village of Fatehgarh Sahib district 2026"
```

## Architecture Overview

1. **FastAPI + SSE Backend (`backend/main.py`, `events.py`)**: Starts asynchronous research runs (`POST /api/research`) and streams live agent events over Server-Sent Events (`GET /api/research/{run_id}/stream`).
2. **LangGraph State Machine (`backend/graph.py`)**: Orchestrates an 8-stage pipeline (`plan` → `search` → `score` → `review` → loop/stop → `write` → `truth_check` → `done`).
3. **Apollo Planner (`agents/apollo_planner.py`)**: Uses `SMART_MODEL` to decompose the topic into 3–5 sections with targeted search queries.
4. **Athena Searcher (`agents/athena_search.py`)**: Executes parallel Tavily web searches and arXiv academic paper queries bounded by `asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_PARALLEL_RESEARCHERS)`.
5. **Pure-Python Source Scorer (`tools/source_scoring.py`)**: Scores every source (`0–100`) by domain authority, content length, and recency, dropping sources below `35` and deduplicating URLs.
6. **Hermes Reviewer (`agents/hermes_review.py`)**: Runs deterministic Python coverage/recency checks first, then uses `SMART_MODEL` to identify missing evidence gaps and "Both Sides" source conflicts.
7. **Deterministic Loop Control (`backend/graph.py`)**: Pure Python conditional edge enforces `MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS` (3) and `RUN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (360s) before looping back to search only for remaining gaps.
8. **Parallel Section Writers + Assembler (`agents/writer.py`)**: Drafts each section in parallel (`FAST_MODEL`) using strictly that section's globally numbered `[n]` sources, then assembles a cohesive report (`SMART_MODEL`).
9. **Truth Meter Verifier (`agents/truth_meter.py`)**: Splits the report into sentences, checks every cited sentence against its cited source text (`FAST_MODEL` + code check for valid IDs), and computes the overall Trust Score.
10. **React + Vite + Tailwind UI (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)**: Displays live SSE events, research controls, configuration, source/platform filtering, and interactive Report, Both Sides, Sources, and Plan views with Markdown/PDF export.
11. **Optional Judge Mode (`agents/judge.py`)**: Adds a separate judging pass for section-by-section evaluation and final quality scoring after the research report is assembled.

## The Three Signature Features

1. **Truth Meter (Sentence-Level Citation Verification)**:
   Every cited sentence in the final report is checked against the actual retrieved text of the source(s) it cites and marked `SUPPORTED` (green), `PARTIAL` (yellow), or `UNSUPPORTED` (red) with an extracted evidence quote on hover and an overall **Trust Score** percentage.
2. **Both Sides (Open Disagreement Detection)**:
   Hermes actively detects places where verified sources disagree (different numbers/percentages, opposite claims, or differing years/regions/methods) and presents Side A vs. Side B comparison cards with clickable source chips and a *"Why they differ"* explanation.
3. **Deterministic Source Quality Badges**:
   Every source receives a credibility score (`0–100`) computed purely in Python code from its domain category (`.gov`/`.edu`/WHO/UN/RBI/PIB, peer-reviewed journals, reputed news, Wikipedia, blogs/forums), content length, and publication recency — badged as **High (`70+`)**, **Medium (`50–69`)**, or **Low (`35–49`)**, while sources below `35` are dropped before writing.

---

## Future Ideas

- **Human Judging**: Let users or domain experts override sentence verdicts and adjust source-credibility weights interactively.
- **Debate Mode**: Put specialized agents on opposing sides of a controversial topic, then synthesize their cited arguments into a balanced conclusion.
- **More Domains**: Add connectors for Finance (SEC/NSE filings, market data), Product Comparison, and other evidence-heavy research categories.
- **Hindi Reports**: Add one-click bilingual/Hindi report generation (`हिन्दी`) while preserving exact `[n]` citations and Truth Meter highlights.
- **Persistent Run History**: Store completed runs in SQLite or local storage so users can revisit, compare, and re-export reports.
